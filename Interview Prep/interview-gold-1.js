 * 1. Implement setInterval using setTimeout
 * setInterval with setTimeout
 *
 * What does it do?
 * - Native setInterval calls function repeatedly at given delay
 * - But it can "drift" if fn takes longer than delay
 *
 * Why implement this way?
 * - setTimeout ensures fn completes before scheduling next run
 * - More accurate for variable-time tasks
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1) per call
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - Prevents overlapping calls
 * - Better for UI tasks where drift is tolerable

// # ðŸ“˜ Key Takeaways

// These are **golden questions** because:

// * They connect directly to **frontend system design** (router, scheduler, VDOM).
// * They test **performance + tradeoffs**.
// * They allow you to show **senior-level thinking** (not just code).

// ---

// # ðŸ“‘ Quick-Reference (Last-Minute Review)

// * **setInterval via setTimeout** â†’ prevents drift, implement clear.
// * **Promise.retry** â†’ retry async fn, exponential backoff.
// * **LRU Cache** â†’ Map, refresh order on access, O(1) ops.
// * **VDOM diff** â†’ O(n), keys optimize.
// * **Tiny Router** â†’ hashchange/history, dynamic params.
// * **Scheduler** â†’ concurrency control, queue tasks.
