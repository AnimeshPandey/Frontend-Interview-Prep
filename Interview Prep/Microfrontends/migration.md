# 🚀 Migration Strategy: Monolithic React SPA → Microfrontends (Module Federation)

---

## 1. 🎯 Goals & Principles

**Business Goals:**

* Enable independent team deploys.
* Reduce CI/CD bottlenecks.
* Improve release velocity.

**Engineering Principles:**

* Incremental adoption (no big bang rewrite).
* Backward compatibility during transition.
* Shared design system to maintain UX consistency.

---

## 2. 🧱 Current State: Monolithic React SPA

* Single repo, single webpack build.
* Shared routing + global state.
* All teams commit to same codebase.
* Deployments = one pipeline → merge conflicts, slow velocity.

---

## 3. 🔄 Target State: MFE with Module Federation

* **Host Shell App**: global router, auth, layout, DS.
* **Remotes**: product-specific apps (Checkout, Cart, Search, Profile).
* Shared dependencies (React, DS) resolved via Module Federation.
* Independent build & deploy pipelines per team.

---

## 4. 🗺️ Migration Phases

### **Phase 1: Preparation (2–4 weeks)**

* Audit monolith: identify **bounded contexts** (e.g., Checkout, Search).
* Extract common **design system** into its own package.
* Standardize linting, TypeScript configs across teams.
* Setup **CI/CD infra** for independent deploys.

**Risks:** DS not adopted → divergence.
**Mitigation:** Enforce DS via PR lint rules + design tokens.

---

### **Phase 2: Shell Setup (2–3 weeks)**

* Create **Host Shell App** with Module Federation enabled.
* Move global concerns here: routing, auth, error boundaries.
* Integrate DS into shell.

**Risks:** Shell becomes bottleneck.
**Mitigation:** Keep shell “thin” → only global infra.

---

### **Phase 3: First Remote Extraction (2–4 weeks)**

* Choose a **non-critical module** (e.g., Profile page).
* Carve it out as **first MFE remote**.
* Expose it via Module Federation → host imports dynamically.
* Deploy independently.

**Risks:** Version mismatch between host & remote.
**Mitigation:** Lock React/DS versions in `shared` config.

---

### **Phase 4: Incremental Carve-Out (2–6 months)**

* One by one, extract verticals (Checkout, Cart, Search).
* Each remote team owns build + deploy pipeline.
* Use **dynamic remotes** for runtime flexibility.
* Run **canary deployments** before full rollout.

**Risks:** Perf regressions due to multiple bundles.
**Mitigation:**

* Preload critical remotes.
* Cache `remoteEntry.js` at CDN.
* Optimize shared deps.

---

### **Phase 5: Governance & Scale (ongoing)**

* Establish **Architecture Review Board**.
* Define **contract for shared deps** (React, DS).
* Monitoring: measure release velocity, perf, RUM metrics.
* Sunset unused monolith code gradually.

**Risks:** Teams diverge → inconsistent UX.
**Mitigation:**

* DS enforced via Storybook + lint rules.
* Periodic cross-team design reviews.

## 5. 🧩 Risks & Mitigations (Interview-Ready)

| Risk                   | Impact                            | Mitigation                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Bundle Duplication** | Perf hit (multiple React copies)  | Use `shared: ["react"]` with singleton setting |
| **Inconsistent UX**    | Fragmented product feel           | Central DS + tokens                            |
| **Perf Overhead**      | Slow load due to multiple bundles | Preload critical remotes, CDN cache            |
| **Auth Duplication**   | Security issues                   | Centralize in Host Shell                       |
| **Team Divergence**    | Tech debt sprawl                  | Governance board + contracts                   |
| **Migration Fatigue**  | Project stalls                    | Do incremental vertical-by-vertical rollout    |

## 6. 📊 Success Metrics

* 🚀 **Velocity**: Increase deploys/week per team.
* ⚡ **Perf**: LCP/TTFB not worsened post-migration.
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Team Autonomy**: # of modules independently owned.
* 🛡️ **Stability**: < 1% error rate in RUM logs post-cutover.

## 7. 🔥 Example Interview Pitch (2–3 min)

> “We’d migrate incrementally. First, extract the design system to enforce UX consistency. Then set up a thin Host Shell with global routing and auth. Next, carve out a small vertical (say Profile) as the first remote to validate Module Federation. From there, migrate critical flows like Checkout one by one, ensuring independent builds & deploys.
>
> The biggest risks are bundle duplication and inconsistent UX, which we’d mitigate with shared deps + centralized DS. Over time, governance is key — a lightweight architecture board ensures React/DS versions stay aligned. The end goal is faster release velocity and team autonomy without breaking user experience.”
