## 1. Performance Budgets (Bytes, JS, Images)

**Problem:**

* Teams add features ‚Üí bundle size + page weight balloons.
* Every extra KB increases **infra costs** (bandwidth) and **user churn** (slower page).

**Solution:**

* Define **performance budgets**:

  * JS ‚â§ 200KB gzipped per route.
  * LCP ‚â§ 2.5s on 75th percentile devices.
  * Max 3 critical CSS/JS requests.

**Detailed Design:**

* Add budget check in CI:

```json
"budgets": [
  { "type": "bundleSize", "maxSize": "200kb" },
  { "type": "timings", "maxDuration": "2.5s" }
]
```

* Tools: Lighthouse CI, webpack-bundle-analyzer.

**Perf/Scaling Notes:**

* Prevents regression creep.
* Forces tradeoffs early.

**Pitfalls:**

* Overly strict budgets ‚Üí block dev velocity.
* Must balance ‚Äúbusiness ROI vs perf cost.‚Äù

**Real-world Example:**

* Google Search mandates ‚â§ 150KB JS for homepage.
* Pinterest reduced bundle by 40% ‚Üí +15% conversions.

**Follow-ups:**

* Why budgets must be per-route, not global?
* How to enforce budgets in CI?
* What‚Äôs the tradeoff between strict vs flexible budgets?

## 2. Infra Cost Awareness (CDN vs Cloud)

**Problem:**

* Frontend traffic = millions of requests/day.
* Serving assets from **origin servers** costs more and adds latency.

**Solution:**

* Push assets to **CDN/edge**:

  * Images, JS, CSS ‚Üí cache at PoPs.
  * APIs with SWR ‚Üí reduce origin hits.

**Detailed Design:**

* Cache headers:

```http
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

* Edge compute: serve **personalized HTML** at CDN layer.

**Perf/Scaling Notes:**

* Reduces infra costs (origin egress).
* Improves latency by 100‚Äì300ms.

**Pitfalls:**

* Stale cache ‚Üí bugs if invalidation hard.
* Edge functions often have runtime limits (50ms, no Node APIs).

**Real-world Example:**

* Netflix streams via CDN (OpenConnect) to cut egress costs.
* Shopify Hydrogen uses Vercel Edge to reduce infra costs globally.

**Follow-ups:**

* Why edge cheaper than cloud for static assets?
* How to balance cache freshness vs cost savings?
* What‚Äôs cost of cache misses?

## 3. Image/Media Optimization

**Problem:**

* Images = **\~60% of typical page weight**.
* Serving raw images ‚Üí wasted bandwidth + CDN cost.

**Solution:**

* Use **responsive, compressed, modern formats (WebP, AVIF)**.
* Serve via **image CDN** (Imgix, Cloudinary, Vercel).

**Detailed Design:**

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="image.jpg" width="600" alt="example" />
</picture>
```

* Lazy-load offscreen images:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" />
```

**Perf/Scaling Notes:**

* Reduces bandwidth costs 40‚Äì70%.
* Faster FP/LCP ‚Üí conversion gains.

**Pitfalls:**

* Too aggressive compression ‚Üí UX harm.
* Browser fallback logic needed.

**Real-world Example:**

* eBay reduced CDN bill by millions via AVIF migration.
* Instagram uses image CDNs for billions of photos.

**Follow-ups:**

* Why AVIF > WebP?
* What‚Äôs tradeoff: infra cost vs image quality?
* How lazy loading affects Core Web Vitals?

## 4. Reducing JavaScript Execution Cost

**Problem:**

* More JS ‚Üí not just network cost but **execution cost** (CPU/battery).
* On low-end devices, parsing + eval can be more expensive than downloading.

**Solution:**

* Reduce shipped JS:

  * Tree-shaking + dead code elimination.
  * Code splitting + lazy loading.
  * Move logic server-side (RSC, edge compute).

**Detailed Design:**

```js
// Dynamic import for rarely used admin panel
if (isAdmin) {
  import("./admin").then(initAdmin);
}
```

**Perf/Scaling Notes:**

* Execution cost can be **3‚Äì4x higher on low-end devices**.
* Reducing JS saves both infra bandwidth + device CPU/battery.

**Pitfalls:**

* Over-splitting = too many network requests.
* Lazy-loaded code can cause UX delay if poorly predicted.

**Real-world Example:**

* Twitter Lite reduced JS by 80% ‚Üí huge cost + perf gains.

**Follow-ups:**

* Why execution cost matters more than bundle size?
* How to balance splitting vs UX?
* What‚Äôs role of React Server Components in cost efficiency?

## 5. Developer Productivity vs Cost

**Problem:**

* Infra cost isn‚Äôt just servers ‚Üí **engineering time = \$\$\$**.
* Slow builds/tests waste thousands of engineer-hours.

**Solution:**

* Optimize developer workflows:

  * Parallel builds (Turborepo, Nx).
  * Remote caching (Bazel, Vite, esbuild).
  * AI-assisted PR reviews (Copilot Chat, CodeQL).

**Detailed Design:**

* Example: CI config caching build:

```yml
cache:
  key: build-cache-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
  paths: .turbo
```

**Perf/Scaling Notes:**

* Dev productivity directly impacts feature velocity ‚Üí cost of delay.

**Pitfalls:**

* Over-optimizing CI/CD may add complexity.
* Remote caching infra requires infra cost itself.

**Real-world Example:**

* Google ‚Üí Bazel saves **millions of build hours/year**.
* Vercel uses Turborepo to speed monorepo builds.

**Follow-ups:**

* Why dev productivity = cost efficiency?
* How to measure cost of wasted build time?
* Tradeoffs of investing in infra vs features?

## 6. Measuring ROI of Frontend Improvements

**Problem:**

* Hard to justify ‚Äúfrontend optimizations‚Äù to business stakeholders.
* Need to prove that cost savings or revenue lift is real.

**Solution:**

* Always tie perf/infra savings ‚Üí **business outcomes**:

  * Lower CDN bills.
  * Higher conversions.
  * Faster iteration velocity.

**Detailed Design:**

* Example calculation:

  * Reducing 200KB JS ‚Üí saves 1PB/year bandwidth ‚Üí \$100k infra savings.
  * Faster LCP ‚Üí +2% conversion ‚Üí \$20M extra revenue.

**Perf/Scaling Notes:**

* Must capture both **direct infra savings** and **indirect business uplift**.

**Pitfalls:**

* Hard to isolate causation.
* Need controlled experiments (Batch #25 topics).

**Real-world Example:**

* Pinterest: perf improvements ‚Üí +15% signups.
* Amazon: 100ms slower ‚Üí 1% sales drop.

**Follow-ups:**

* How to estimate \$\$ impact of perf work?
* Why ROI framing matters for frontend leadership?
* Example ROI calc for reducing API latency.

## 7. Cost-Aware API Design (Frontend <-> Backend)

**Problem:**

* Poor API design = extra requests, redundant data transfer ‚Üí bandwidth waste.

**Solution:**

* Cost-efficient API patterns:

  * GraphQL ‚Üí fetch exactly what‚Äôs needed.
  * Batching ‚Üí fewer round-trips.
  * Compression (gzip, Brotli).

**Detailed Design:**

```graphql
query {
  user {
    id
    name
    avatar
  }
}
```

vs REST returning full user profile (wasted data).

**Perf/Scaling Notes:**

* Fewer bytes ‚Üí lower CDN + infra cost.
* Improves TTFB ‚Üí conversion lift.

**Pitfalls:**

* GraphQL resolvers can be inefficient if not optimized.
* Over-batching ‚Üí large payloads = slow parse.

**Real-world Example:**

* Facebook ‚Üí GraphQL to reduce redundant mobile API calls.
* Airbnb ‚Üí compressed JSON API to cut infra bills.

**Follow-ups:**

* Why GraphQL often more cost-efficient than REST?
* When batching becomes counterproductive?
* What‚Äôs tradeoff between payload size vs request count?
