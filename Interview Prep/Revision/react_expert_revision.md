# 🟦 React Core Fundamentals (Expert Level)

---

## 1. 🎭 Virtual DOM (VDOM)

**Definition:**
The **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight in-memory tree representation of the actual DOM. React diffs the VDOM against a previous version to compute the minimal set of changes and applies them to the real DOM.

### ✅ Key Points

* Avoids expensive DOM mutations by batching and diffing.
* Abstracts away browser DOM inconsistencies.
* Works via **reconciliation** (diffing algorithm).

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* VDOM is not always faster — for **simple static pages**, raw DOM is faster.
* Frequent re-renders of large trees → reconciliation overhead.
* DOM mutations inside `useLayoutEffect` or refs can **bypass VDOM** — can cause sync issues.

### Example

```jsx
// React maintains a virtual representation
<div className="item">Hello</div>
```

When state updates → React creates a new VDOM tree, diffs it with old, and mutates only changed nodes.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “The Virtual DOM is React’s in-memory representation. It enables efficient diffs and minimal DOM updates, though reconciliation itself has cost.”

---

## 2. 🧮 Reconciliation Algorithm

**Definition:**
The process of comparing old and new VDOM trees to decide what to update in the real DOM.

### ✅ Diffing Rules

* Elements of **different types** → destroy & recreate subtree.
* Elements of **same type** → update props and recurse.
* Lists → require **keys** for identity.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* **Keys must be stable and unique**. Index keys cause bugs if list reorders.
* Changing key forces remount (state reset).
* Deep trees may be skipped if React bails out early (e.g., `shouldComponentUpdate` or `memo`).

### Example

```jsx
{items.map(item => (
  <Item key={item.id} value={item.value} />
))}
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Reconciliation compares old/new trees. Keys are critical — unstable keys break identity and cause unnecessary remounts.”

---

## 3. 🧵 React Fiber Architecture

**Definition:**
**Fiber** is React’s reimplementation of the reconciliation algorithm as a **linked-list tree of work units**, enabling incremental rendering and prioritization.

### ✅ Key Points

* **Fiber node = virtual stack frame** (represents component & state).
* Enables **time slicing**: pause/resume rendering.
* Each update has a **priority level (lane)**:

  * High → user input.
  * Low → background rendering.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Fiber means React can **pause rendering mid-tree** and resume later. Side effects must only run in commit phase.
* Updates may be **interrupted and restarted** — never rely on render being called exactly once per update.

### Example (mental model)

```text
Root Fiber → Child Fiber → Sibling Fiber
Each fiber has: type, pendingProps, memoizedState, return, child, sibling
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Fiber is React’s linked-list architecture that enables pausing, resuming, and prioritizing work. Render is interruptible, commit is not.”

---

## 4. ⚙️ React Rendering Phases

**Definition:**
React rendering happens in **two phases**:

1. **Render Phase (reconciliation):**

   * Build Fiber tree, diff with old tree.
   * **Pure & interruptible**.

2. **Commit Phase:**

   * Apply DOM mutations.
   * Run layout effects (`useLayoutEffect`).
   * Trigger lifecycles.
   * **Synchronous & non-interruptible**.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Render can run multiple times per update (especially in StrictMode).
* Side effects must not run in render phase (causes bugs in concurrent mode).
* Layout effects block paint until executed.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Render is pure and may be interrupted or restarted. Commit applies changes to the DOM and always runs synchronously.”

---

## 5. ⏳ Component Lifecycle (Class vs Hooks)

### ✅ Class Lifecycle

* **Mount:** constructor → render → componentDidMount
* **Update:** render → componentDidUpdate
* **Unmount:** componentWillUnmount

### ✅ Hook Equivalents

* `useEffect` → componentDidMount/Update (async, after paint).
* `useLayoutEffect` → sync after DOM mutation, before paint.
* `useEffect` cleanup / `useLayoutEffect` cleanup → componentWillUnmount.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* StrictMode double-invokes lifecycle methods in dev.
* `useEffect` runs after paint → may cause flicker for measurements.
* `useLayoutEffect` blocks paint → don’t overuse.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Class lifecycle maps to hooks. `useEffect` runs async after paint, `useLayoutEffect` runs sync before paint. Use the latter sparingly for DOM measurements.”

---

## 6. 📜 Rules of Hooks

**Definition:**
Hooks must be called **at the top level of a component or custom hook**.

### ✅ Rules

1. Only call hooks in React functions.
2. Always call hooks in the same order.

### Why?

* Hooks rely on array-like ordering in Fiber.
* Violations break hook state tracking.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Conditional hooks → break order.
* Loops with hooks → break order.

### Example

```jsx
// ❌ Wrong
if (cond) useState(1);

// ✅ Right
const [x, setX] = useState(1);
if (cond) { ... }
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Hooks are tracked by call order, not names. That’s why they must run unconditionally at the top level.”

---

## 7. 🎛️ Context API Internals

**Definition:**
Provides a way to pass values deeply without prop drilling.

### ✅ Key Points

* Uses a Provider + Consumer (or useContext).
* Each Context has its own Fiber subscription list.
* Any value change triggers re-render for **all consumers**, unless optimized.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* **Performance pitfall**: Every consumer re-renders even if not using changed parts.
* Fix: split contexts, use memoized values, or libraries like Zustand.
* Don’t store derived values in Context unnecessarily (causes extra re-renders).

### Example

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
function App() {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark"><Child /></ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Context avoids prop drilling but re-renders all consumers on change. Optimize with memoized values or split contexts.”

---

## 8. 🎹 Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

**Definition:**

* **Controlled:** Form input state lives in React.
* **Uncontrolled:** Input state lives in DOM, accessed via refs.

### ✅ Tradeoffs

* Controlled → easier validation, predictable state, re-render cost.
* Uncontrolled → better performance, harder validation.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Mixing controlled/uncontrolled on same input → React warning.
* Controlled components must update value on every change.

### Example

```jsx
// Controlled
<input value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />

// Uncontrolled
<input defaultValue="hello" ref={ref} />
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Controlled inputs sync state to React, while uncontrolled rely on the DOM. Controlled are predictable but heavier.”

---


# 🟦 State Management (Built-in + External)

---

## 1. 🎛️ `useState` vs `useReducer`

### ✅ `useState`
- Simple state, single value updates.  
- Good for UI-local state (inputs, toggles).  
- Updates **replace** state, not merge.  

### ✅ `useReducer`
- More structured, centralizes update logic.  
- Better for **complex transitions** or state machines.  
- Reducer function makes updates predictable (pure).  

### ⚠️ Gotchas
- `setState` is async but **batched** in React 18.  
- Stale closures if accessing state in async callbacks.  
- `useReducer` is stable across re-renders → avoids dependency hell.  

### Example
```jsx
function counterReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "inc": return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "dec": return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default: return state;
  }
}
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Use `useState` for simple, isolated state. Use `useReducer` when state transitions are complex or when debugging predictability matters.”

---

## 2. 🌐 Local vs Global State

### ✅ Local State
- Component-specific (UI interactions).  
- Keep as local as possible for performance & maintainability.  

### ✅ Global State
- Shared across large parts of the app (auth, theme, user data).  
- Can cause **over-rendering** if managed poorly.  

### ⚠️ Gotchas
- Overusing global state → hard to reason about.  
- Storing **derived values** globally → redundant re-renders.  

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Keep state as local as possible. Promote to global only when multiple areas need it — overusing global state makes debugging harder.”

---

## 3. 📦 Context API for State

### ✅ Key Points
- Good for low-frequency global state (theme, auth, i18n).  
- Bad for high-frequency updates (chat messages, real-time counters).  

### ⚠️ Performance Pitfall
- Any value change re-renders **all consumers**, even if they don’t use the changed fields.  

### Fixes
- Split contexts by domain (AuthContext, ThemeContext).  
- Use memoized values:
```jsx
<AuthContext.Provider value={useMemo(() => ({user, login}), [user])}>
```
- Use selector libraries (Zustand, Jotai).  

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Context works for low-frequency global state, but high-frequency updates cause over-renders. Fix with memoization, splitting, or external stores.”

---

## 4. 🗃️ Redux

### ✅ Strengths
- Predictable state container (single source of truth).  
- Strict unidirectional data flow.  
- Great for debugging (Redux DevTools, time travel).  

### ⚠️ Weaknesses
- Boilerplate-heavy (reducers, actions).  
- Overkill for small apps.  
- Frequent re-renders unless using selectors.  

### Modern Redux (RTK)
- Redux Toolkit simplifies boilerplate.  
- Immer for immutable updates.  
- Built-in async thunks.  

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Redux provides predictable global state with time-travel debugging. Modern RTK removes boilerplate and uses Immer for immutability.”

---

## 5. 🧵 Zustand, Recoil, Jotai (Modern State Libraries)

### ✅ Zustand
- Minimal, no boilerplate.  
- Store is just a hook:
```js
const useStore = create(set => ({ count: 0, inc: () => set(s => ({ count: s.count+1 })) }));
```
- Fine-grained reactivity (components subscribe to slices).  

### ✅ Recoil
- Atom-based (pieces of state are independent).  
- Derived values via selectors.  
- Plays well with concurrent rendering.  

### ✅ Jotai
- Primitive atoms (similar to Recoil, simpler).  
- Directly use hooks for atom state.  

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Modern libraries like Zustand and Recoil fix Context’s perf issues by letting components subscribe to slices of state instead of the whole store.”

---

## 6. 🧩 Event-Driven vs Snapshot State

### ✅ Snapshot (React default)
- You always render the latest snapshot.  
- Changes trigger a re-render.  

### ✅ Event-driven (rare but useful)
- Instead of syncing state → broadcast events (pub/sub).  
- Useful for **real-time apps** (chat, notifications).  

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “React state is snapshot-based. For real-time event-driven scenarios, combine with pub/sub systems to avoid re-render storms.”

---

## 7. 🗄️ Normalized State

**Definition:**  
Represent relational data in flat structures (like a database).  

### ✅ Why
- Avoids deep nested updates.  
- Improves memoization (can compare by ID).  

### Example
```js
// ❌ Nested
state = { users: [{ id: 1, posts: [{id: 5}]}] };

// ✅ Normalized
state = { users: {1: {id:1, posts:[5]}}, posts: {5: {...}} };
```

### Tools
- Redux Toolkit’s `createEntityAdapter`.  
- Normalizr library.  

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Normalize relational state to flat structures. This avoids deep updates and enables efficient memoization.”

---

## 8. 🧊 Immutable Updates

**Definition:**  
React state must not be mutated directly — immutability ensures predictable diffs.  

### ✅ Tools
- Spread operator, `Object.assign`.  
- Immer (used by Redux Toolkit).  

### ⚠️ Gotchas
```js
// ❌ Mutation
state.user.name = "Alex"; 

// ✅ Immutable update
state = { ...state, user: { ...state.user, name: "Alex" } };
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “React relies on immutability to detect changes. Mutating state directly breaks reactivity and can cause stale renders.”

---


# 🟦 Performance & Optimization

---

## 1. 🧭 Understanding Re-Renders

**Definition:**
A component re-renders when its **state or props change**, or when its parent re-renders and passes new references.

### ✅ Key Points

* React compares new vs old VDOM → reconciles differences.
* Even if output is identical, reconciliation still happens.
* Render ≠ always commit (render can be interrupted).

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Passing new object/array literals causes re-renders:

```jsx
<MyComp data={{x:1}} /> // new object each render
```

* Context updates re-render all consumers.
* `React.memo` prevents re-render only if props shallow-equal.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Re-renders happen on state/prop changes or parent updates. Passing new object references or Context changes are common perf killers.”

---

## 2. 🪞 React.memo, useMemo, useCallback

### ✅ React.memo

* Wraps component → shallowly compares props.
* Prevents unnecessary re-renders.

### ✅ useMemo

* Memoizes **values** between renders.
* Expensive computations or derived values.

### ✅ useCallback

* Memoizes **functions** → prevents creating new fn refs.
* Useful when passing callbacks to memoized children.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* `useMemo/useCallback` themselves add cost — only use when necessary.
* Shallow comparison means nested objects still cause false negatives.
* Over-memoization can worsen performance.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “React.memo avoids re-renders by shallow prop compare. useMemo memoizes values, useCallback memoizes functions. Overusing them can hurt, not help.”

---

## 3. 🔄 Batching Updates

**Definition:**
React groups multiple state updates into one render.

### ✅ Before React 18

* Batching happened only inside event handlers.

### ✅ React 18+

* Batching happens in **all contexts** (timers, async callbacks, promises).

### Example

```jsx
setCount(c => c+1);
setValue(v => v+1);
// React 18 → one render
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “React 18 enables automatic batching everywhere, reducing re-renders. Before 18, batching was limited to event handlers.”

---

## 4. ⚡ Concurrent Rendering

**Definition:**
React 18’s **Concurrent Mode** (enabled by default) allows rendering to be interruptible, paused, or restarted based on priority.

### ✅ Key Points

* Enables **time slicing** — responsive UI during rendering.
* New APIs: `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`.
* Doesn’t change final UI, just how React schedules updates.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Render can happen multiple times before commit.
* Side effects must be in commit phase (`useEffect`, not render).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Concurrent rendering lets React pause and resume work based on priority. It doesn’t change the UI outcome, only the scheduling.”

---

## 5. 🕹️ useTransition & useDeferredValue

### ✅ useTransition

* Splits updates into **urgent** vs **non-urgent**.
* Keeps UI responsive during heavy re-renders.

```jsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
startTransition(() => setSearchResults(expensiveCompute(query)));
```

### ✅ useDeferredValue

* Defers updating a value until less urgent work is done.

```jsx
const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “useTransition marks updates as non-urgent, keeping UI responsive. useDeferredValue delays expensive renders until idle.”

---

## 6. 📦 Virtualization (Large Lists)

**Definition:**
Render only visible items in a list instead of all at once.

### ✅ Libraries

* `react-window`, `react-virtualized`.

### ✅ Benefits

* Huge perf gains for 10k+ items.
* Reduces DOM nodes drastically.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Needs correct height calculation.
* Accessibility and SEO challenges (hidden elements not available).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Virtualization renders only visible list items. Essential for huge datasets, but requires careful handling of heights and accessibility.”

---

## 7. 🎭 Suspense for Data Fetching

**Definition:**
Suspense lets components “wait” for async data before rendering fallback UI.

### ✅ Key Points

* Suspense boundaries prevent waterfalls.
* Used with React 18 data frameworks (Next.js, Relay).
* Works with streaming SSR.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Suspense **only** handles promises, not arbitrary async.
* Error handling must use Error Boundaries.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Suspense lets React wait for async data with fallbacks. It simplifies async UI but needs Error Boundaries for failure cases.”

---

## 8. 🧩 Avoiding Expensive Renders

### ✅ Techniques

* **Windowing/virtualization** for long lists.
* **Throttling/debouncing** user input.
* **Lazy load components** (`React.lazy`).
* **Selective Context** (split providers).
* **Selector hooks** (subscribe to slices of state).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Optimize renders by memoizing, windowing lists, debouncing inputs, lazy loading code, and splitting state into smaller contexts.”

---

## 9. 📊 Debugging Performance

### ✅ Tools

* **React DevTools Profiler** (flame graph of renders).
* `why-did-you-render` library (detects unnecessary renders).
* Browser Performance tab.

### ✅ Common Symptoms

* Re-render storms.
* Input lag.
* Flickering UI.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Use React Profiler and why-did-you-render to spot re-render storms. Input lag or flickering often means wasted renders.”

---


# 🟦 Advanced Hooks & Patterns

---

## 1. 🛠️ Custom Hooks (Encapsulation & Reuse)

**Definition:**  
Custom hooks are user-defined functions that **use other hooks** to encapsulate reusable logic.  

### ✅ Key Points
- Encapsulate side effects, subscriptions, state machines.  
- Return values (state, handlers) just like built-ins.  
- Naming convention: `useSomething` ensures linting rules apply.  

### Example
```jsx
function useOnlineStatus() {
  const [online, setOnline] = useState(navigator.onLine);
  useEffect(() => {
    const update = () => setOnline(navigator.onLine);
    window.addEventListener("online", update);
    window.addEventListener("offline", update);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("online", update);
      window.removeEventListener("offline", update);
    };
  }, []);
  return online;
}
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Custom hooks let you extract reusable stateful logic. They’re just functions that call hooks and return state/handlers.”

---

## 2. 🧮 Hook Composition vs HOCs vs Render Props

### ✅ Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
- Function that wraps a component → returns new component.  
- Used for cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging).  

### ✅ Render Props
- Component accepts a function as `children` or `prop` → renders custom UI.  

### ✅ Hooks
- Modern replacement for both — composable, less nesting.  

### ⚠️ Gotchas
- HOCs increase component tree depth (“wrapper hell”).  
- Render props cause “function as child” nesting.  
- Hooks keep tree flat but can cause dependency confusion in `useEffect`.  

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Hooks replace HOCs and Render Props for reusing logic. They’re flatter and composable, but you must manage dependencies carefully.”

---

## 3. 🧩 Compound Components Pattern

**Definition:**  
Builds components that work together as a set, sharing state via Context or props.  

### ✅ Example
```jsx
function Tabs({ children }) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(0);
  return (
    <TabsContext.Provider value={{active, setActive}}>
      {children}
    </TabsContext.Provider>
  );
}
function TabList({ children }) { return <div>{children}</div>; }
function Tab({ index, children }) {
  const {active, setActive} = useContext(TabsContext);
  return <button onClick={() => setActive(index)}>{children} {active === index && "*"}</button>;
}
```

### ✅ Benefits
- Great for design systems.  
- Flexible API (consumer composes layout).  

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Compound components let you build flexible APIs where multiple components share context state, like Tabs, Accordions, or Menus.”

---

## 4. 🧮 Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components (Revisited)

- **Controlled** → Parent owns state.  
- **Uncontrolled** → DOM owns state (access via ref).  

### ✅ Pattern
Some advanced components support **both** via `value` + `defaultValue`.  

### Example
```jsx
function Input({ value, defaultValue, onChange }) {
  const [internal, setInternal] = useState(defaultValue || "");
  const isControlled = value !== undefined;
  const val = isControlled ? value : internal;

  function handleChange(e) {
    if (!isControlled) setInternal(e.target.value);
    onChange?.(e);
  }
  return <input value={val} onChange={handleChange} />;
}
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Controlled components sync state to React, uncontrolled use refs. Advanced components often support both by checking for `value` prop.”

---

## 5. 🔗 Prop Getters Pattern

**Definition:**  
A function returns props you spread onto elements, letting consumers extend behavior.  

### ✅ Example
```jsx
function useToggle() {
  const [on, setOn] = useState(false);
  const toggle = () => setOn(o => !o);
  function getTogglerProps(props = {}) {
    return {
      "aria-pressed": on,
      onClick: (e) => { props.onClick?.(e); toggle(); },
      ...props
    };
  }
  return { on, getTogglerProps };
}
```
Usage:
```jsx
const { on, getTogglerProps } = useToggle();
<button {...getTogglerProps({ onClick: () => console.log("clicked") })}>
  {on ? "On" : "Off"}
</button>
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Prop Getters let custom hooks merge consumer props with internal behavior — ensuring accessibility and extensibility.”

---

## 6. 🎛️ Refs & Imperative APIs

### ✅ useRef
- Holds mutable values across renders without triggering re-renders.  
- Common for DOM access.  

### ✅ forwardRef
- Lets parent pass refs down to child components.  

### ✅ useImperativeHandle
- Expose **custom methods** from a component via ref.  

### Example
```jsx
const FancyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const inputRef = useRef();
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => inputRef.current.focus()
  }));
  return <input ref={inputRef} {...props} />;
});

const ref = useRef();
<FancyInput ref={ref} />;
ref.current.focus();
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Refs provide imperative escapes. forwardRef passes refs down, useImperativeHandle customizes exposed APIs.”

---

## 7. ⏱️ useEffect vs useLayoutEffect

### ✅ useEffect
- Runs after paint → async, non-blocking.  
- Good for subscriptions, async calls.  

### ✅ useLayoutEffect
- Runs **synchronously after DOM mutations but before paint**.  
- Good for DOM measurements, sync mutations.  

### ⚠️ Gotchas
- Using useLayoutEffect for heavy work blocks paint → jank.  
- Server-side rendering warns if you use useLayoutEffect (no DOM).  

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “useEffect runs async after paint; useLayoutEffect runs sync before paint — use the latter only for DOM measurements.”

---

## 8. 🛡️ Error Boundaries

**Definition:**  
React components that catch errors in children and render fallback UI.  

### ✅ Key Points
- Class components only (`componentDidCatch`).  
- Catch render, lifecycle, commit errors.  
- Don’t catch async errors (use try/catch in async).  

### Example
```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };
  static getDerivedStateFromError() { return { hasError: true }; }
  componentDidCatch(error, info) { console.log(error, info); }
  render() { return this.state.hasError ? <h1>Oops</h1> : this.props.children; }
}
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner  
> “Error Boundaries catch render/lifecycle errors in children and show fallback UI. They don’t catch async errors or event handlers.”

---


# 🟦 React Concurrent Features & Architecture

---

## 1. 🧵 Fiber Deep Dive

**Definition:**
Fiber is React’s internal data structure (a linked list of “units of work”) that enables **interruptible, prioritized rendering**.

### ✅ Key Points

* **Fiber Node** stores:

  * type (component/function)
  * pendingProps, memoizedState
  * child, sibling, return pointers (tree shape)
* Enables React to **pause rendering mid-tree**, yield to higher-priority work, then resume.
* Each Fiber node corresponds to one component instance.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* **Render can be restarted** — never rely on render running exactly once.
* Effects must run in **commit phase**, not render.
* Updates can be **reordered** for performance (concurrent mode).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Fiber is React’s linked-list tree of work units. It makes rendering interruptible, resumable, and prioritizable.”

---

## 2. 🛣️ Lanes & Scheduling (React 18)

**Definition:**
React assigns updates to **lanes** — priority buckets for scheduling work.

### ✅ Key Points

* Urgent → user input (click, typing).
* Normal → data updates.
* Idle → background rendering.
* React merges lanes when possible to batch updates.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Updates may **not flush immediately** — React may wait until a higher-priority update occurs.
* Debugging lag requires understanding scheduling lanes.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “React uses lanes to schedule updates by priority. User input gets high priority, background renders get low. This keeps apps responsive.”

---

## 3. ⏳ Render vs Commit (Revisited)

* **Render phase**

  * Build Fiber tree, diff with previous.
  * Interruptible.
  * No DOM mutations.

* **Commit phase**

  * Apply DOM changes.
  * Run layout effects & lifecycles.
  * Non-interruptible.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* StrictMode can trigger **double-invoked renders** to expose side effects.
* Commit phase runs synchronously — avoid blocking.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Render is interruptible and pure, commit is synchronous and mutates the DOM. All side effects belong in commit.”

---

## 4. ⏱️ Concurrent Rendering

**Definition:**
Introduced in React 18: rendering is no longer “all or nothing”. React can **pause, resume, restart** renders.

### ✅ Benefits

* Keeps input responsive during heavy rendering.
* Splits urgent vs non-urgent updates.
* Enables new APIs (`useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`).

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Component render functions can run multiple times without committing.
* Must avoid side effects in render (or cause bugs).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Concurrent rendering lets React pause and resume work. This keeps UIs responsive but means renders can restart anytime.”

---

## 5. 🕹️ Transition API

### ✅ useTransition

* Marks state updates as non-urgent.
* Keeps urgent work (typing, clicks) responsive.

```jsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
startTransition(() => {
  setSearchResults(expensiveQuery(query));
});
```

### ✅ useDeferredValue

* Defers value updates until React is idle.

```jsx
const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “useTransition splits urgent vs non-urgent updates. useDeferredValue delays heavy computations until idle.”

---

## 6. 📦 Suspense for Data (React 18+)

**Definition:**
Suspense boundaries allow components to **wait for promises** before rendering fallback UI.

### ✅ Key Points

* Works with streaming SSR.
* Integrates with frameworks like Next.js (app router).
* Prevents waterfalls by suspending at boundaries.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Suspense doesn’t handle errors → must use Error Boundaries.
* Data fetching must throw a promise to suspend (React Query, Relay do this).

### Example

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Profile />
</Suspense>
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Suspense lets React pause rendering for async data, showing fallback UI. It simplifies async orchestration in concurrent rendering.”

---

## 7. 🌐 Streaming SSR & Suspense

**Definition:**
React 18 added **streaming server rendering** with Suspense support.

### ✅ Key Points

* Server sends HTML chunks progressively.
* Suspense boundaries can stream in later.
* Improves TTFB (time to first byte).

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Requires careful hydration (client must resume correctly).
* Progressive hydration needed to avoid blocking interactivity.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Streaming SSR sends HTML in chunks with Suspense boundaries, improving TTFB and avoiding full-page blocking.”

---

## 8. 🧑‍💻 React Server Components (RSC)

**Definition:**
New model where some components **render on the server only**.

### ✅ Key Points

* RSCs don’t ship JS to client → smaller bundles.
* Can fetch data directly (no hooks).
* Can stream into client tree.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Server & client components must be carefully separated.
* Not fully mature outside Next.js App Router yet.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “React Server Components let some components render only on the server, reducing client JS and enabling data-fetching at the component level.”

---

## 9. 🧩 Hydration & Variants

**Definition:**
Hydration = React attaches event listeners to server-rendered HTML.

### ✅ Variants

* **Partial Hydration** → only hydrate interactive parts.
* **Islands Architecture** → hydrate independent sections separately.
* **Selective Hydration (React 18)** → React hydrates higher-priority parts first.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Mismatch between server/client markup → hydration errors.
* Must ensure deterministic render output.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Hydration attaches React to server HTML. React 18 does selective hydration, hydrating high-priority parts first.”

---

## 10. ⚙️ React Compiler (Meta’s new optimization)

**Definition:**
Upcoming optimization that **auto-memoizes components** by analyzing dependencies.

### ✅ Key Points

* Removes manual `useMemo` / `useCallback` needs.
* Still experimental, but already used internally at Meta.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “React Compiler automatically memoizes components by analyzing dependencies, reducing the need for manual useMemo/useCallback.”

---


# 🟦 React and the Browser

---

## 1. 🎯 React’s Synthetic Event System

**Definition:**
React wraps native browser events in a **SyntheticEvent** object for consistency across browsers.

### ✅ Key Points

* React normalizes event names/behavior.
* Events are **pooled** for performance (object reused).
* Handlers receive the synthetic event, not the native one.
* If you need the native event → use `event.nativeEvent`.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Event pooling can cause bugs:

```jsx
function handleClick(e) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(e.type)); // ❌ e is null (pooled)
}
```

Fix:

```jsx
e.persist(); // prevents pooling
```

* Since React 17+, event delegation attaches at the root container, not `document`.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “React wraps events in a SyntheticEvent for cross-browser consistency. They’re pooled by default, so use `e.persist()` if async access is needed.”

---

## 2. 🪟 Portals

**Definition:**
Portals allow rendering children into a DOM node outside the parent hierarchy.

### ✅ Use Cases

* Modals, tooltips, dropdowns (avoid z-index hell).
* Fixed-position UI that must escape overflow/position contexts.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Events **still bubble through React tree**, not DOM hierarchy.
* CSS scoping issues: portal content may escape styling context.

### Example

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(<Modal />, document.getElementById("modal-root"));
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Portals let you render components outside parent DOM hierarchy but keep React’s event bubbling intact. Ideal for modals & tooltips.”

---

## 3. ⏱️ Concurrent Input Handling

**Definition:**
React 18 uses concurrent rendering to keep **inputs responsive** during heavy updates.

### ✅ Patterns

* `useTransition`: defer expensive UI while typing remains smooth.
* Debouncing or throttling input handlers.
* Offload expensive work to Web Workers if needed.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Without transitions, large lists can lag when filtering.
* Transition fallback (`isPending`) must show loading state gracefully.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Concurrent input handling keeps typing responsive during heavy renders using transitions, deferrals, and sometimes workers.”

---

## 4. 🎨 CSS-in-React Strategies

### ✅ Options

1. **CSS Modules** → Scoped per file, no runtime cost.
2. **CSS-in-JS (styled-components, Emotion)** → Dynamic styling, runtime overhead.
3. **Utility-first (Tailwind)** → Atomic classes, fast builds.
4. **Vanilla Extract, Linaria** → Zero-runtime CSS-in-JS.

### ✅ Performance Considerations

* CSS-in-JS creates runtime overhead (inserts `<style>` at runtime).
* Tailwind/atomic CSS minimizes runtime but can bloat HTML.
* CSS Modules = simple & performant default.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “CSS-in-React strategies vary: CSS Modules are simple & fast, CSS-in-JS offers flexibility with runtime cost, Tailwind optimizes for dev speed.”

---

## 5. ♿ Accessibility (a11y)

**Definition:**
Ensuring UI works for all users, including assistive technologies.

### ✅ Key Points

* Use semantic HTML (`<button>` instead of `<div onClick>`).
* ARIA roles and attributes for assistive tools.
* Keyboard navigation (tab order, focus management).
* Color contrast compliance (WCAG AA/AAA).
* `aria-live` regions for async updates.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Custom components (e.g., `<div role="button">`) require **manual keyboard handlers**.
* Portals can trap focus if modals don’t manage it.

### Example

```jsx
<button aria-pressed={on}>Toggle</button>
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Accessible React means using semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and proper focus management. Accessibility isn’t optional at scale.”

---

## 6. ⚡ Browser APIs in React

### ✅ Common Integrations

* **IntersectionObserver** → lazy load images, infinite scroll.
* **ResizeObserver** → adapt to element size changes.
* **MutationObserver** → detect DOM mutations.
* **requestIdleCallback** → schedule background work.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Must clean up observers in `useEffect` cleanup.
* Observers fire frequently → debounce or throttle updates.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “React integrates with browser observers (Intersection, Resize, Mutation) for performance-sensitive UIs. Always clean up listeners.”

---

## 7. 🧩 Browser Rendering vs React Rendering

### ✅ Browser Rendering

* HTML → DOM → CSSOM → Render Tree → Layout → Paint → Composite.

### ✅ React Rendering

* VDOM diff → Fiber scheduling → Commit → DOM mutation → Browser rendering pipeline.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* React may **skip DOM updates** if VDOM diff sees no changes.
* But every render still costs JS time → optimize unnecessary renders.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Browser rendering = layout/paint. React rendering = VDOM diff → DOM mutation. Both must be optimized separately.”

---


# 🟦 Large-Scale React Application Architecture

---

## 1. 🧱 Component-Driven Development (CDD)

**Definition:**
Build applications from **small reusable components** upward, using a design system.

### ✅ Key Points

* Atomic Design: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages.
* Storybook or Ladle for component isolation.
* Components must be **stateless + composable** where possible.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Too much abstraction leads to “prop soup.”
* Teams must align on design tokens (spacing, colors, typography).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “CDD means building from reusable components, often with a design system, to scale consistency across teams.”

---

## 2. 🎨 Multi-Tenant Theming

**Definition:**
Supporting multiple brands or tenants from the same codebase.

### ✅ Techniques

* **CSS Variables:** Themeable at runtime:

```css
:root { --primary: blue; }
[data-theme="dark"] { --primary: black; }
```

```jsx
<button style={{ color: "var(--primary)" }}>Click</button>
```

* **Context Providers:** Provide theme object via React context.
* **Design Tokens:** Abstract theme into JSON tokens → consumed by CSS-in-JS, CSS vars, or native CSS.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Context re-renders on theme switch.
* Dynamic imports for brand assets.
* Multi-tenant SSR must inject correct theme per request.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Multi-tenant theming is solved with design tokens + CSS variables, allowing runtime theme switching without rebuilds.”

---

## 3. 🗂️ Monorepos & Code Sharing

### ✅ Approaches

* **Turborepo / Nx:** Efficient build & caching.
* **Yarn Workspaces / pnpm Workspaces:** Share deps.
* **Component packages:** Internal NPM libraries for design system.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Dependency hoisting issues.
* Cross-package version drift.
* Need CI/CD pipelines that handle partial builds.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Monorepos with tools like Nx/Turborepo enable shared design systems and libraries, but need caching and dependency management.”

---

## 4. 🌍 Micro-Frontends (Module Federation)

**Definition:**
Splitting large apps into independently deployable React apps.

### ✅ Key Points

* Webpack Module Federation: load remote components at runtime.
* Teams deploy independently, reducing coordination.
* Shared dependencies (React, design system) must be singleton.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Cross-microfrontend routing.
* State sharing between MFEs is tricky.
* Performance hit if federation is misconfigured (duplicate Reacts!).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Micro-frontends split large React apps into independently deployable modules, often via Module Federation. Great for org scaling, tricky for state & routing.”

---

## 5. 🛡️ Error Boundaries at Scale

### ✅ Patterns

* Wrap critical UI chunks (e.g., dashboard widgets).
* Provide **segmented recovery** → one widget fails, rest continue.
* Show fallback UI with retry.

### Example

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<RetryButton />}>
  <Widget />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Don’t wrap the whole app with one boundary — loses isolation.
* Errors in async code aren’t caught.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “At scale, error boundaries must isolate failures per feature, ensuring one broken widget doesn’t take down the entire app.”

---

## 6. 📊 Logging, Monitoring, Observability

### ✅ Key Points

* **Frontend Observability** includes:

  * Error tracking (Sentry, Datadog, New Relic).
  * Performance metrics (LCP, FID/INP, CLS).
  * User interactions (heatmaps, logs).
* Centralized logging pipeline → correlate frontend errors with backend logs.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* GDPR/PII compliance: don’t log sensitive data.
* Sampling needed at scale (don’t log every keystroke).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Frontend observability at scale means error tracking + performance metrics + logs, tied to backend systems. Logging must respect privacy laws.”

---

## 7. 🔒 Security in React Apps

### ✅ Common Threats

* **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**

  * Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
  * Sanitize user input (DOMPurify).

* **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**

  * Use SameSite cookies or CSRF tokens.

* **Clickjacking:**

  * X-Frame-Options headers.

* **Dependency vulnerabilities:**

  * Regular audits with `npm audit`, Snyk.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Don’t trust client-side validation → always validate server-side.
* Don’t roll your own sanitizer.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “React itself mitigates XSS by escaping content, but security requires sanitizing inputs, protecting cookies, and hardening dependencies.”

---

## 8. 🏗️ Scalability Best Practices

* **Code splitting** → lazy load per route.
* **Component boundaries** → minimize prop drilling, use context sparingly.
* **Selective hydration** → hydrate only critical UI.
* **Consistent architecture** → enforce with ESLint + TypeScript.
* **Team-level contracts** → clear ownership of shared libraries.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Scaling React apps requires modular architecture, code splitting, selective hydration, and strong governance over shared libraries.”

---


# 🟦 React with Data & Networking

---

## 1. 📡 Data Fetching Strategies

### ✅ Approaches

1. **Manual fetch in useEffect**

   * Simple, but prone to race conditions & missing caching.
2. **Global fetchers (React Query, SWR, Apollo)**

   * Cache + deduplication + retries built-in.
3. **Server Components (RSC)**

   * Data fetched on the server → no client fetch needed.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* `useEffect(fetch)` → risks double-fetch in StrictMode.
* Must abort stale requests (`AbortController`).
* Data fetching **belongs outside render** → don’t fetch inside components without memoization.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Manual fetching works for small apps, but React Query/SWR handle caching, retries, deduplication. RSC moves fetching server-side.”

---

## 2. 🗃️ Caching Approaches

### ✅ Snapshot Cache (React Query, SWR)

* Store last response in cache.
* Deduplicate identical queries.
* Stale-while-revalidate pattern:

  * Show cached data immediately.
  * Refresh in background.

### ✅ Normalized Cache (Apollo, Relay)

* Cache data by entity ID (like a client-side DB).
* Avoids duplicate entities in memory.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Normalized caching = more boilerplate.
* Snapshot caching = easier, but duplicates possible.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Snapshot caches store responses; normalized caches deduplicate entities by ID. Use normalized caching when relational data needs consistency.”

---

## 3. 🕹️ Suspense for Data Fetching

**Definition:**
React Suspense lets components “pause” until a Promise resolves.

### ✅ Key Points

* Works with data libraries that throw promises.
* Boundaries prevent waterfall loading.
* Enables streaming SSR.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Must combine with Error Boundaries.
* Not production-ready for all cases yet (needs framework support).

### Example

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Profile />
</Suspense>
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Suspense lets components wait for promises, showing fallbacks instead of loaders everywhere.”

---

## 4. 🔄 Optimistic UI & Rollbacks

**Definition:**
Update the UI immediately on user action, then reconcile with server response.

### ✅ Key Points

* Increases responsiveness.
* Requires rollback if server rejects update.

### Example (React Query)

```js
mutate(newTodo, {
  optimisticUpdate: cache => [...cache, newTodo],
  onError: (err, _, rollback) => rollback(),
});
```

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Rollbacks must restore consistent state.
* Concurrency issues if multiple mutations overlap.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Optimistic UI updates immediately for responsiveness, but requires rollback on failure. Libraries like React Query automate this.”

---

## 5. 🌊 Streaming Data (Realtime)

### ✅ Approaches

* **WebSockets:** Full-duplex, bidirectional.
* **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** One-way streaming from server → client.
* **GraphQL Subscriptions:** Built on WebSockets.

### ✅ React Integration

* Store messages in state or external store (Zustand).
* Use Suspense for initial load, event-driven updates after.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Must handle reconnects.
* Avoid memory leaks by unsubscribing on unmount.
* Overusing Context for streaming data → re-renders every message.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Real-time data uses WebSockets, SSE, or GraphQL subscriptions. Integrate with React using stores or selectors to avoid re-render storms.”

---

## 6. ⚠️ Handling Race Conditions

### ✅ Problem

If a user types quickly, multiple fetches may return out of order.

### ✅ Solutions

* **AbortController:** cancel stale requests.
* **Latest-only strategy:** track request ID.
* **Data libraries:** React Query handles deduplication.

### Example

```js
const controller = new AbortController();
fetch("/api?q=term", { signal: controller.signal });
controller.abort(); // cancel previous request
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Prevent race conditions by aborting stale requests (AbortController) or using libraries with deduplication.”

---

## 7. 🧩 Error Handling in Data

### ✅ Patterns

* Wrap fetches with Error Boundaries.
* Show segmented error UI (not one giant crash).
* Retry with exponential backoff.

### Example (React Query)

```js
useQuery("todos", fetchTodos, { retry: 3, retryDelay: 2000 });
```

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Handle data errors gracefully: retries, error boundaries, and segmented fallback UI.”

---

## 8. ⚡ Data Prefetching & Dehydration

### ✅ Prefetching

* Fetch data before navigation → instant page load.
* Frameworks like Next.js, Remix automate this.

### ✅ Dehydration

* Server fetches data → serializes into HTML → client hydrates cache.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Prefetching and dehydration make data instantly available on navigation by preloading or hydrating caches.”

---


# 🟦 Testing & Quality in React

---

## 1. 🧪 Testing Levels in React

### ✅ Unit Tests

* Smallest piece (function, hook, component).
* Isolated from external systems.

### ✅ Integration Tests

* Multiple components working together.
* Focus on behavior (e.g., form validation).

### ✅ E2E (End-to-End) Tests

* Full app in browser (Cypress, Playwright).
* Test real user flows (login, checkout).

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Too many unit tests = brittle, low confidence.
* E2E tests = slow, flakier, but higher confidence.
* Best strategy = **Testing Pyramid** (more unit, fewer E2E).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Use a pyramid: many unit tests, fewer integration tests, and critical E2E flows. Don’t over-invest in one level.”

---

## 2. 📚 React Testing Library (RTL)

**Definition:**
The de-facto standard for testing React components.

### ✅ Key Points

* Encourages **testing behavior, not implementation**.
* Query DOM with **role, text, label** instead of class names.
* Built on top of DOM Testing Library.

### Example

```jsx
render(<button>Click</button>);
fireEvent.click(screen.getByText("Click"));
expect(screen.getByRole("button")).toBeEnabled();
```

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Avoid testing internal states (`wrapper.state()`).
* Prefer `userEvent` over `fireEvent` for realistic interactions.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “RTL tests React by user behavior, not internals — query by role/label, simulate real events with userEvent.”

---

## 3. 🧑‍🔬 Snapshot Testing

**Definition:**
Tests that render component → compare output to saved snapshot.

### ✅ Key Points

* Fast way to catch unexpected UI changes.
* Great for static, predictable components (icons, design tokens).

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Overused snapshots → noisy diffs, brittle tests.
* Not a substitute for behavior tests.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Snapshots are useful for static UI checks, but overusing them leads to brittle tests. Prefer behavioral assertions.”

---

## 4. 🔌 Mocking APIs

### ✅ Common Tools

* **jest.mock** for modules.
* **fetch mocks** with `jest-fetch-mock`.
* **Mock Service Worker (MSW):** intercepts fetch/XHR → simulates API at network layer.

### ✅ MSW Example

```js
rest.get("/user", (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(ctx.json({ name: "Alice" }));
});
```

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Don’t mock too low-level → tests become unrealistic.
* MSW > manual mocks because it simulates the network layer.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Mock APIs at the network layer with MSW for realistic tests. Avoid low-level mocks that make tests lie.”

---

## 5. 🎭 E2E Testing (Cypress / Playwright)

### ✅ Key Points

* Simulate full browser environment.
* Test critical flows: login, checkout, dashboard.
* Integrates with CI pipelines.

### ✅ Differences

* **Cypress:** simple API, auto-wait, great ecosystem.
* **Playwright:** faster, better cross-browser & parallel support.

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Flaky tests from network delays → fix with retries or MSW.
* Keep E2E tests **minimal but critical** (happy path + critical edge cases).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Use E2E tests for mission-critical flows. Cypress is popular, Playwright is faster and cross-browser. Keep them lean.”

---

## 6. 📊 Performance Testing

### ✅ Tools

* **React Profiler API** → measure render times.
* **Lighthouse** → web vitals (LCP, FID/INP, CLS).
* **WebPageTest** for network analysis.

### ✅ Strategies

* Write automated perf budgets → fail CI if LCP/CLS regress.
* Use flame graphs in Profiler to find re-render storms.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Performance tests track user-centric metrics (LCP, INP, CLS). Use React Profiler + Lighthouse, and enforce budgets in CI.”

---

## 7. 🧩 Testing Hooks

### ✅ Tools

* **@testing-library/react-hooks** (deprecated, now in `@testing-library/react`).

### Example

```js
function useCounter() {
  const [c, setC] = useState(0);
  return { c, inc: () => setC(c+1) };
}
const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter());
act(() => result.current.inc());
expect(result.current.c).toBe(1);
```

### ⚠️ Gotchas

* Always wrap state updates in `act()`.
* Don’t over-test hooks — test their consumer components instead.

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner

> “Hooks can be tested directly with renderHook, but prefer testing components that consume them for realistic behavior.”

---

## 8. 🛡️ Best Practices for React Testing

* Test **user behavior, not implementation**.
* Minimize mocks → prefer integration-level tests.
* Keep snapshots small and targeted.
* Use MSW for realistic API mocking.
* Focus E2E tests on **critical flows only**.
* Measure performance with budgets in CI.
* Maintain test pyramids → don’t drown in E2E tests.
