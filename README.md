# Frontend Interview Preparation and Deep-Dive 🚀

This repository is a **comprehensive preparation pack for Senior/Staff Frontend Engineer interviews** at top companies.  

It includes:
- **Polyfills & Core JS Implementations** (Array, Promise, DOM)
- **Lodash-style Utilities** (debounce, throttle, cloneDeep, groupBy)
- **System Design Playbooks** (Microfrontends, Theming, Realtime Collab, etc.)
- **Advanced Frontend Coding Problems** (Virtual DOM, Scheduler, Diff, Trie Autocomplete…)
- **Simulation-style Discussions** with step-by-step constraints (how interviewers escalate problems)

## 🔑 Key Topics Covered

### 1. Polyfills & Core JS
- `Array.prototype.myMap`, `myFilter`, `myReduce`, `mySort`
- `Promise` polyfill, `Promise.all`, `Promise.any`
- DOM APIs: `document.getElementsByClassName`, `getElementsByTagName`

📌 **Why they matter:**  
Classic interview favorites. Forces you to explain **time complexity, space complexity, and sparse array behavior**.

---

### 2. Lodash-style Utilities
- `debounce()` (with async + cancel support)
- `throttle()` (with async promise support)
- `cloneDeep()` (handles cycles with WeakMap)
- `groupBy()`, `chunk()`, `mapAsync()`, `mapWithChunksAsync()`
- Key converters: `toCamelCase`, `toSnakeCase`

📌 **Why they matter:**  
These are **practical JS exercises** interviewers love because they test **real frontend problem-solving** (search bars, scroll handlers, deep object manip).

---

### 3. Advanced Frontend Problems
- **Virtual DOM (diff + patch)** → like React reconciliation  
- **Scheduler Polyfills** (`setTimeout`, `requestIdleCallback`)  
- **Event Delegation System** → React Synthetic Event model  
- **Promise Pool / Concurrency Limiter**  
- **Diff Algorithm for JSON** (compare two trees, minimal diff)  
- **Trie-based Search Autocomplete**  

📌 **Why they matter:**  
Tests your ability to **scale UI rendering & async handling**.

---

### 4. System Design Playbooks
Each problem simulated like an **interviewer escalation scenario**:

- **Microfrontend Router** (routing + remote module loading + state sharing)  
- **Component Library** (tokens, a11y hooks, theming with CSS vars)  
- **Multi-tenant Theming System** (white-label SaaS, brand overrides)  
- **Feature Flags** (runtime toggles, rollout %, remote config)  
- **i18n Framework** (translations, interpolation, pluralization, fallback)  
- **Realtime Collaboration** (Google Docs OT vs CRDT, offline sync)  

📌 **Why they matter:**  
These are **staff-level discussions** that separate seniors from leads.

---

### 5. Scalability & Reliability
- Infinite Scroll Virtualization  
- Lazy Image Loader (IntersectionObserver + scroll fallback)  
- Fetch Polyfill (timeout + retries + backoff)  
- Static Site Outline Generator (TOC builder)  
- CSS Cascade Simulator (specificity, inheritance, inline styles)  
- Responsive Grid Engine (like CSS Grid placement)

📌 **Why they matter:**  
Demonstrates ability to handle **perf bottlenecks** and **large datasets**.

---

## 🎯 Interview Strategy

Each problem is covered in **step-by-step escalation style**:
1. Start simple (baseline solution).  
2. Interviewer adds constraints (e.g., performance, async, accessibility).  
3. Extend solution.  
4. Discuss **tradeoffs + real-world comparisons** (React, Webpack, LaunchDarkly, i18n frameworks).  

This makes you:
- Confident in **coding round**  
- Strong in **system design round**  
- Able to **defend tradeoffs** in **staff-level discussions**

## ⚡️ Why This Repo?

Most repos just dump code.
This repo focuses on **simulation-style practice**:

* What an interviewer would ask first.
* How they would escalate.
* What follow-up discussions to expect.

By rehearsing with this, you’ll have **ready answers for twists** and **clear tradeoff reasoning**.

## 📌 Credits

This repository was prepared as a **personal deep-dive study kit** for senior frontend interview prep — but can be reused by anyone preparing for **Senior/Staff/Lead frontend roles**.

# 🚀 Good luck — and remember:

It’s not just about solving problems, it’s about **showing tradeoffs, scaling, and real-world awareness**.
